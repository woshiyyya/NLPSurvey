## Definition 1. 
Textual entailment is defined as a directional relationship between pairs of text expressions, denoted by T - the entailing “Text”, and H - the entailed “Hypothesis”. We say that T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T, as would typically be interpreted by people.
